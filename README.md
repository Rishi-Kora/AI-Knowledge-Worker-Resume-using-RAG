# AI Knowledge Worker Resume using RAG

![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

> **RAG**: Because your resume shouldn’t just be “good,” it should be “Retrieval-Augmented Great.” 😎

---

## 🚀 What Is This?

A Jupyter Notebook–powered toolkit that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to help you craft a knockout resume. Feed it your raw career data (LinkedIn exports, old CVs, brag-worthy project notes), and let an AI do the heavy lifting—so you can spend your time practicing interview answers (or napping).

---

## 🛠️ Features

- **Semantic Bullet Wizardry**: AI-powered rewriting of your career highlights so they sing (literally, if you ask nicely).  
- **Contextual Knowledge Fetch**: Instantly pulls in role-specific buzzwords and metrics (because “improved performance” is good—but “boosted query throughput by 37%” is eyebrow-raising).  
- **Customizable Prompts**: Tweak the system prompts to match your personal style (from “Suits & Ties” to “Casual Friday”).  
- **Export-Ready Output**: Copy-and-paste markdown or PDF snippets directly into your favorite resume template.
